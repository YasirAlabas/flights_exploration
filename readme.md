# Flights Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consisted of 114135 flights that have been taken during the 4 first months of year 2020 in the US(right before flight lockdown went active in most countries because of the COVID-19 pandemic). The data consists of flight ids, flight destanation and origin, payload, mail, as well as passenger related information like number of passengers transformed and the number of seats that each flight harber. The data also includes the name of the carrier's company and the service class in each flight. There are some additional information about the aircrafts but we will not use those because they are irrelevant to our data exploration objectives.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration phase, a notable relation between passenger count and month was found in the dataset, as the months went on, the number of passengers declined, the decline was gradual until the fourth month of the first quarter of 2020, where the transformation from March to April saw a steep decline in the number of passengers, due to the COVID-19 virus. Which triggered multiple countries in the world to perform a flight lockdown in that period, indicating the damage the pandemic had on the flight industry.

Another interesting find was the number of service classes passengers used to board, with the majority of passengers boarding first class flights, followed by buisness class. We also found the top five flight companies that had the most trips in Q1 of 2020, and found that of these five companies, United Airlines had the highst passenger to seat ratio, indicating that it was the most successful in insuring that most of its aircrafts were packed. Finally, we found that the number of full first boaders passenger/seat ratio declined in the first four months of 2020 while the buisnees class ratio rose in the fourth month surpasing the full firs ratio. 

## Key Insights for Presentation


In the presentation, I tried to concentrate on the changes in the decline of number of  flights as well as the changes in the passenger/seat ratio, I left out the class information as I wanted to concentrate on these two factors. I showed how the number of flights declined during the first quarter of 2020 with a sharp decline in April after the flight lockdown in most countries went active. I then showed the top airlines that were active during that period and how the passenger/seat ratio differed from company to company, explaining that although SkyWest airlines had the most flight trips, United Airlines was the most successful in selling their flight seats.
